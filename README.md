## Installation
to Install the game, simply download the zip file to your desktop. double click the zip file to unzip it (on a Mac device) or a file unzipper software to access the folder. 

Once the folder is open, locate the “index.html” file, right click and open in your web browser (i.e. chrome, Firefox, Explorer). Now you are ready to play the game! 

## How to Play

Flip over two tiles at a time to reveal their icon. if the icons match each other the tile will turn green and remain flipped. Continue to do this till all the tiles on the grid are flipped over and matched. try to beat your best score by finding the pairs faster and in fewer moves. the more stars you have the better your score. 
Good luck!

## Current Code Bugs:

1. There is an issue with the star rating as it doesn't change through out the game. 
2. The modal that shows the player's sore and a button to play again is not showing after all
the cards match.
